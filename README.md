We all like cats, but not everython on the internet lives up to that potential.
Fortunately not there's a chrome extension to make sure your web viewing is
always pleasant! Nothing But Cats makes use of the [Place Kitten](https://placekitten.com) api.

## âœ¨ Installation

2. Open [Chrome Extensions chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
